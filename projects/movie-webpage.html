            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>After finishing our learning on how to code basic HTML and CSS, my SEP 10 teacher Mr. Mueller wanted us to practice our skills, to create one whole project. This project being the "Movie Webpage Project". During this project we were given quite a lot freedom, with the concpet being anything that we want it to be. Though as any other project, we were given a set of requirements to meet in our code, and we also had to work with a partner. </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>As I mentioned breiefly in my "Content" section, we had to cread a movie webpage using what we learned from basic HTML and CSS. There was a set requirements for the HTML portion and the CSS portion that was mandated to be in your webpage if you wanted full credit. For the HTML portion you would have to include headings, paragraphs, div(s) and spans(s), inputed Google Fonts, and inputs and submits. For the CSS potion of the webpage you would have to add selectors (elements, class, and id), and the box model (padding, margin, and border). We were also required to add images that are either creative common or our own images. Another the requirements were to created a plan, using markdown, which is something that we learned in Unit 0. Markdown could be considered to be a more simpler version of HTML, being known for it's simpllicity. We had to use markdown to create our plan, and split up who does what in the project. </p>
         <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>I was able to get through most of this project with ease with the help of my partner and me taking advantage of the resources that I was given. Though I believed something that we struggled with the most is thinking of our idea. We already knew that we were going to do a superhero concept for our project, but we just didn't know what to make the superhero based about. Which was fundamental for us, since we needed to think of a superhero with a certain concept that can match the visual theme of our webpage, this is because we were going to custmon make our images. Intially we thought that we were going to make our superhero "BackPack Man", but we found that to hard to do because it would have been hard to create images centering a backpack. We then switched to "Brick Man", since we found that a image of a brick will be easy to customize into our images.</p>
            <p>Another challenge that I faced was more of a personal challenge, which was creating the inputs and submits. This part of the HTML portion was my task, and I choose to take it on because of my unfarmiliarity with it. While doing the "Free Code Camp" lessons on inputs and submits, I was able to get through the lessons rather quickly, but I wasn't able to get the information from the lessons to stick with me. Sure I had notes on it, but it wasn't enough for me to fully grasp and process the information. When I was first trying to create the input and submits I tried looking for the notes I had on it, but realized that it wasn't very helpful since it was talking about radio buttons, when I wanted to make my input and submit to be a email input. I was able to figure out that all input and submits use the "form" selector, and that you would have to use the input type "email". The only way I was able to figure this out is by using the resource "W3Schools" which gives information on pretty much every piece of code in HTML and CSS.</p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>One of the major things that I took away from this project is collaboration and how if you want to properly collaborate with someone you would have to communicate with them. We wouldn't have been able to complete this project without the other, I needed my partner to help create the images and box model portion, and my partner needed me to do the inputs and submut plus the span(s) div(s). Without the other doing their portion we would not have meet the full requirements to fully complete our project. And if we hadn't communicated with each other we would not have gotten the outcome that we both wanted in the end. Which is why I was able to learn the importance of collaboration and communication in collaboration.</p>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>I plan to work more on the visual aspect of the webpage more if I have the time, this is because I would like to make the backgound of the webpage to match the theme more. Something else I plan to do, is probably change the organization of the images on the webpage, instead of it being all vertically place, I will make them all have different arrangements around the webpage, adding a bit of creativity to the webpage. Other than that I am really proud of the work that me and my partner had done on the webpage.</p>
