            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>After finishing our learning on how to code basic HTML and CSS, my SEP 10 teacher Mr. Mueller wanted us to practice our skills, to create one whole project. This project being the "Movie Webpage Project". During this project we were given quite a lot freedom, with the concpet being anything that we want it to be. Though as any other project, we were given a set of requirements to meet in our code, and we also had to work with a partner. </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>As I mentioned breiefly in my "Content" section, we had to cread a movie webpage using what we learned from basic HTML and CSS. There was a set requirements for the HTML portion and the CSS portion that was mandated to be in your webpage if you wanted full credit. For the HTML portion you would have to include headings, paragraphs, div(s) and spans(s), inputed Google Fonts, and inputs and submits. For the CSS potion of the webpage you would have to add selectors (elements, class, and id), and the box model (padding, margin, and border). We were also required to add images that are either creative common or our own images. Another the requirements were to created a plan, using markdown, which is something that we learned in Unit 0. Markdown could be considered to be a more simpler version of HTML, being known for it's simpllicity. We had to use markdown to create our plan, and split up who does what in the project. </p>
         <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>I was able to get through most of this project with ease with the help of my partner and me taking advantage of the resources that I was given. Though I believed something that we struggled with the most is thinking of our idea. We already knew that we were going to do a superhero concept for our project, but we just didn't know what to make the superhero based about. Which was fundamental for us, since we needed to think of a superhero with a certain concept that can match the visual theme of our webpage, this is because we were going to custmon make our images. Intially we thought that we were going to make our superhero "BackPack Man", but we found that to hard to do because it would have been hard to create images centering a backpack. We then switched to "Brick Man", since we found that a image of a brick will be easy to customize into our images.</p>
            <p>Another challenge that I faced was more of a personal challenge, which was creating the inputs and submits. This part of the HTML portion was my task, and I choose to take it on because of my unfarmiliarity with it. </p>
