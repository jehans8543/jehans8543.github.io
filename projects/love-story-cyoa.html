            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Now that we have completed the Github unit in our SEP 10 course, we would now have to put everything that we learned into one big project. This project being the Choose Your Own Adventure Project, oftentimes it is an interactive story in which the player makes decisions that can impact the outcome of the game. And we were expected to make one of these games using what we learned from Github such as linking files and using the command line.  In this project we would have to work in groups and create a project based on a certain topic. The topic that me and my partner had to work on is making a love story. In this project we were given quite a lot of freedom in terms of making the story, though we had to meet a certain list of requirements when it comes to the github portion of the project.</p>
          <h2>Content</h2>
          <p>As I mentioned briefly in the “Context” section, we were mandated to create our project using what we learned about Github and the command line. Before we could even start the project we first had to make a plan, which was also 20% of our grade. The plan that we made included the folders and text files and brief descriptions on what it’s going to be about and its connection to one another. On this very plan we were able to decide who gets to do what, and how each folder would link to one another. After figuring out how to make the folders, we were then able to make the files that were also mandatory being worth 30% in our project since without them we would have no way to link the folders to one another.</p>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>While learning about Github in our SEP 10 course I was able to get through much of it with ease. Therefore I did not really struggle as much as I thought I would while making this project. Though something that I did find myself struggling with is the logistics of the whole project, especially while making the plan. While creating the plan with my partner I was confused in the order of things. We were told to make our plan out of arrows and boxes, and originally while creating my section of the plan I didn’t know what represents what. Whether the arrows represented the files or the folders the same went vice versa for the boxes. Though as I observed what my partner was doing I started asking him questions in order to clarify what it is that we have to do. He told me that the boxes represent the files that are being linked to each other and the boxes represent the different choices. Even by his explanation I still found myself being confused, until he demonstrated it to me using one of the examples that were provided to us. After hearing his explanation and demo I was finally able to fully understand how to properly create the plan. Which helped me out a lot, since without creating a proper plan I would be even more confused on how to link the files and folders together in my project.</p>
          <h2>Takeaways</h2>
          <p>The major thing that I was able to take away from this project is the importance of seeing examples, and taking advantage of your resources. What I mean by this is that without previewing the example of Mr.Mueller’s project I wouldn’t have been able to understand how the linking worked. And without my partner’s step by step explanation on how the plan is supposed to go, I would have taken a big risk and messed up the whole flow of our project. Which taught me without taking advantage of your resources and using examples provided it could put your work at risk.</p>
          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>The next steps that I plan to take is to further improve on my Github skills. This is because knowing how to use Github and command line is a skill that can be convenient to know moving further, especially if I plan to take a career related to computer science. In order to further improve on my skills I plan to continue tinkering with the command line in my IDE when we work on future projects and on my own time in general.</p>
