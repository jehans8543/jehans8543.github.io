            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP 10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Being a SEP student means that we have to create and complete a year long freedom project based on everything we learned in that year. For the SEP 10 freedom project we had to make a webpage on any topic we want, using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and the tool that we indepdently reserached. Throughout the year we would work little by little on this project. As we finished the entirety of our SEP 10 course, we learned we started to work on the freedom project everyday, and for myself I would work on it almost everyday any chance I got.</p>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>The contents of my freedom project consisted of techonologies (hardwares and softwares) that made government tasks easier. I also thought of innovations that could be made or further develop usign AI to make these taks even more easier to complete</p>

            <p>My website consisted of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Though I found myself heavily relying on bootstrap to make my website more organized and visually appleasing. The tool that I used for my project was <em>animate.css</em>, which allowed me to add subtle animations to make each portion of my website stand out more. Since I had extra time remaining, I decided to do some further research and try incooperating some javascript into my website, and I choose to use <em>javascript particles</em>. These particles would move behind my website and if you hovered your cursor over them it would move.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h3><strong>Challenges</strong></h3>
            <p>I faced a variety of challenges while creating my project, though I would say that my two main problems was <strong>relearning how to use bootstrap</strong> and <strong>getting started</strong>.</p>

            <p>The reason why I say relearning how to use boostrap, is because I was terrible at it (I got a 6/10 on my boostrap quiz). The only thing I knew how to do was to add components, which all you had to do is just copy and paste it. I didn't know anything above it, such as editing those components or the grid system which ended up being a key feature of my website. When I was trying to relearn bootstrap, I tried rewatching the video that my teacher made about it, though I was still a bit confused after that. Therefore, I started looking and reading the information they had on the offical boostrap website. I was able to get the main gist of it, especially after looking at the example code. After some more hands on practice with it on my code, I was officially able to overcome my challenges with bootstrap, and use it well on my website.</p>

            <p>Getting started was also another major challenge for me to overcome. In the begining I wasn't very cond of coding, especially since I wasn't very good at it. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't know how to use boostrap, which set me back a lot and made it even harder for me to be motivated to get started. But I was quickly able to overcome this challenge because, I wanted to test out what I was learning about boostrap. I decided the best way to test it on was on my project, thinking that I can learn how to become better at coding along the way. And once I started understanding what I was doing I got super into it. To the point that I was working on it every second that I got. Allowing me to overcome the challenge of getting started, because once I did it didn't seem as bad after all.</p>

            <h3><strong>Takeaways</strong></h3>
            <p>My biggest takeaway from this challenge is learning how to indepdently learn something. Such as how I was able to understand a major topic such as boostrap, in a short amount of time. The only reason I was able to do this is because I was able to practice what I learned and interact with it as much as I can. For me I found out that I learn best when I am able to actually interact and practice what I am learning. And I intend to use this lesson everytime I'm trying to learn something no matter what it is.</p>

            <h3><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3>
            <p>Though I found myself being proud of my overall product, I believe that I could have enhanced my website even further if I added some of the outside resources to my website, which is something that I plan to do for my next project. I also plan to choose a topic that I can be more creative with, since when we were presenting our projects at an expo, I got feedback from the judges that I should be more creative, and I intend to incooperate that feedback in my next project.</p>
